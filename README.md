## Overview

This projects aim for identifying on users location based on the predefined areas. when a user is detected to be in the provided areas. it is location is stored in the database.

project only offers several services to perform this feature. every service is provided a detailed description

#### 1-) User

it makes it possible to create an user on the system so that its location could be tracked . we must save at least one person in the system or else the logic is most likely lead to problem

```http
   
   ### { "name": "mert", "id": 6}
   POST http://localhost:3000/users
   Content-Type: application/json

   { 
     "name": "mert",
   }

  ### Expect [ { "id": 2, "name": "can" }, ... ]
   GET http://localhost:3000/users

   ```
#### 2-) Area

it enables us to define as many areas as we wish alongside their coordinates. please ensure you are transmitting location in the correct format otherwise it will cause a bug 

```http
   
   ### { "name": "mert", "id": 6}
   POST http://localhost:3000/areas
   Content-Type: application/json

  {
    "name": "area",
    "coordinates": [
        {
            "lat": 41.0722589,
            "lng": 28.9085927
        },
        {
            "lat": 41.0564687,
            "lng": 28.9077344
        },
        {
            "lat": 41.0668233,
            "lng": 28.9326253
        },
        {
            "lat": 41.0722589,
            "lng": 28.9085927
        }
    ]
}

  ### Expect [...Array Of Areas]
   GET http://localhost:3000/areas

   ```
#### 3-) Locations

people constantly publish their location and in case its location lies inside the defined areas. location is logged.



```http
   
   ### { "name": "mert", "id": 6}
   POST http://localhost:3000/locations
   Content-Type: application/json

  {
    "lat": 41.06306977527203,
    "lng": 28.918199771163952,
    "userId": 5
  }

  ### Expect [...Array Of Locations]
   GET http://localhost:3000/locations

   ```
#### 4-) Logs

this is the last service which is responsible for return logs of those location are detected to be inside an area.


```http
   
   ### [
    {
        "id": "46e8e957-cc82-4d07-b71e-94a73e220265",
        "content": "Location is in area area",
        "payload": [
            {
                "userId": 5,
                "locationId": "88e36290-43d9-4760-a86a-792d28a9d3da"
            }
        ],
        "created_at": "2025-03-17T06:09:59.346Z",
